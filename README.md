# daylight-calendar-screensaver
Swift based daylight calendar screensaver for OSX.

Takes computer time and calculates current positions of planets, sunrise, sunset, length of day, lunar phase and shows current time as 24-hour clock with relative positions of planets and coloured to reflect daylight.

Will add timezone and lat/lng config options in the future.

More of an experiment than a very practical clock.
